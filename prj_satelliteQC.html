                    This work was carried out as a mini-project, as part of the original 
                    RESTORE-2050 project, for which the model domain was extended beyond 
                    Europe, to Sahara, to estimate the potential for deploying cost-effective 
                    solar energy in this large desert area. Sahara, one of the worldâ€™s 
                    largest deserts, is considered an attractive site for harnessing solar 
                    energy, due to its abundant year-round insolation and availability of 
                    large surface areas that are rarely useful for other purposes (such as 
                    agriculture or sustaining civilization). In fact, the entire desert has 
                    a potential to produce more than 22 billion GWh of solar energy per year. 
                    Also, the abundance of direct normal irradiance (due to rare cloud conditions) 
                    over this region makes it a perfect site to deploy large-scale concentrated 
                    solar power (CSP) technology. In practise, however, this requires long-term 
                    analysis of solar irradiance over the entire region of interest. Due to the 
                    lack of available ground-based sensors, usage of satellite images to retrieve 
                    cloud information and correspondingly calculate solar irradiance is ideal in 
                    this case. For this purpose, Meteosat satellite images were used to calculate 
                    solar irradiance time-series. Two generations of satellites (Meteosat First 
                    Generation [MFG] and Meteosat Second Generation [MSG]) were operational during 
                    the simulation period with the former covering 2003-2005 and the latter covering 
                    a time period of 2005-2012. To our dismay it was identified that the existing 
                    algorithm to retrieve solar irradiance from MSG satellite required some improvements. 
                    As a reference, images from MFG satellite were used for the overlapping year of 2005, 
                    and it was immediately identified that the existing database of MSG satellite 
                    had some corrupted images, which include images with strange artefacts and some 
                    problems with the image headers. There were also frequent occurrence of sudden 
                    dips around local noon times in Spring and Fall that were completely absent when 
                    MFG dataset was used instead. Our investigations suggested that these were the 
                    effects from certain anisotropic effects, that arise from the sun-satellite 
                    geometry. They can often cause a sudden brightening of the images, which are 
                    misinterpreted as detection of clouds. As a work-around, the albedo was recalculated 
                    over a group of 10-days instead of the usual 30-days, to ensure grouping over days 
                    with similar reflectivity patterns, for the Spring and Fall months. For further 
                    quality control, images with strange artefacts and corrupted headers were also 
                    removed and the time series was interpolated to take care of the missing time 
                    stamps. As a result of this newly calculated albedo, a comparison between the 
                    original and the updated time series showed a correlation coefficient of around 
                    0.983 during Spring and Fall, and remained as high as almost 0.999 for the other 
                    seasons. With the deployment of these steps, the quality of the direct normal 
                    irradiance, and by extension the power from CSP plants, were largely enhanced, 
                    and so did the capacity factor for each year from 2005-2012.
