                        <p class="post-text">
                        On April 5, 2020, India stood in solidarity to pay tribute to the frontline warriors of COVID-19 
                        pandemic as a response to the appeal made by country’s prime minister Mr Narendra Modi two days 
                        earlier to turn off ligh...ts at every house for nine minutes at 9 pm to display country’s collecHve 
                        endeavour to fight the virus. Undoubtedly a noble mission, however left the Power System OperaHon 
                        CorporaHon Ltd. (POSOCO) with an enormous and unprecedented challenge on how to ensure power grid 
                        stability when handling such massive jumps nationwide within very small window of time.
                        <span class="dots">...</span>
                        <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                        In order to best realize the true nature of the concern, one must first understand how the operational 
                        power grid works. The most critical task of the grid operators is to match the power demand on the 
                        consumpHon side to the power produced on the supply side at all times. Indian power grid operates at 
                        a voltage of 50 Hz which is a critical aspect for grid’s stability. Any deviaHon beyond the range of 
                        49.5 - 50.2 Hz can cause the power grid to collapse, damaging equipments and leaving a large number 
                        of people without electricity. This is what happened in July 2012, when two separate events of massive 
                        power transmission failures submerged around 700 million people in darkness. Ever since then, system 
                        engineers are extremely cautious of any event that may cause rapid changes in mismatch between power 
                        demand and power generations. Any remaining mismatch must be covered in real time without compromising 
                        the grid frequency beyond its permitted limits.
    
                        While it is possible to estimate or forecast the changes in demand from a drop in electricity demand 
                        in the residency sector, modulating the production side in a coherent manner against such high ramps 
                        in not easy. This is mainly because of the inertia in thermal power plants. Most of them function as 
                        base load plants (which means their production does not vary much over time in response to the demand, 
                        but they cover a substantial share of demand coverage) and if shut down, they require a couple of hours 
                        before they can get operational again.
                            
                        Apart from these technical issues, there were a few other problems, which caused deeper concerns to 
                        the management. The power grid infrastructure in India is not state-of-the-art, its resilience is 
                        often questioned, many appliances connected to the grid are outdated and poorly maintained. Additionally, 
                        India lacks adequate spinning reserves for ancillary services which are suitable for balancing operations 
                        in real time. Also, smart grids are not yet widely deployed in India. In most cases, they have been 
                        envisioned, projects are running, but implementing them to be operational will still require another 
                        decade or so. And then, to make matters worse, there is the problem with social media that grossly 
                        exaggerated the potential for a nation-wide grid collapse, the risk of damaging the appliances if left 
                        connected to the grid during blackouts and introduced more panic among the mass. The speculation of 
                        possible damage of electric equipments led people to turn off refrigerators, fans, and other electrical 
                        appliances alongside with the lights in their home. This created a massive gap between what was 
                        precedented by POSOCO for a power drop exclusively by turning off the lights as appealed by the PM and 
                        the actual power drop. Based on the detailed information available from consumer data, load composition 
                        etc, POSOCO estimated a power drop around 14 GW, but it turned out to be around 31 GW, more than twice 
                        as big as predicted. It is a pity how mainstream media often disregard the facts and publish news based 
                        on hypes instead of reaching out to actual experts on the field. Thankfully, POSOCO had set a wide margins 
                        of error into their projections as accurately predicting the behaviour of 1.3 billion people is inherently 
                        a complex task and this allowed them to meticulously plan the grid management accordingly.
                            
                        The government officials were optimistic about the impact of this event on the state of the national grid. 
                        It was highlighted that the ongoing nation-wide lockdown had already reduced the demand by 30% from its 
                        peak. Even so, the remaining mismatch was too high to be mitigated with conventional generation facilities. 
                        The hydropower stations, which account for roughly 10% of India’s electricity demand, have played a key 
                        role in carrying out the entire endeavour due to its inherent flexible nature to ramp up/down its production 
                        within minutes.
                            
                        POSOCO carried out the entire operation by gradually reducing power from the thermal plants close to minimum 
                        before the onset of the event and relied on the flexible nature of hydro power plants. The hydro power 
                        generation was first maximised at 8:45 PM, and then between 08:45 PM to 9:10 PM, the generation was reduced 
                        from 25559 MW to 8019 MW, a drop of 17543 MW, in response to the reduced demand. The hydro generation was 
                        again ramped up to 19012 MW by 09:27 PM since demand started to come back after the passing of the event. 
                        During the whole time, grid frequency was successfully maintained within a band of 49.7 to 50.26 Hz. The 
                        management of this entire event was carried out step-by-step in an excellent way with synchronous efforts 
                        from power system operators, utility scale generators, and even those from the private sector. The sharing of 
                        information between national and state-level agencies have also facilitated better decision making in real time.
                            
                        While the original idea was to support those fighting against the corona virus, I think it is also essential 
                        to applaud those who were involved in the operation of the power grid during those critical 9 minutes and 
                        ensured a successful and smooth execution of an extremely challenging task. This achievement should have a 
                        positive impact on India’s green energy trajectory. In spite of all the problems we know we have in India, 
                        to our surprise this astounding nation has once again proved that Indian power grid is ready for a new-era 
                        heading towards a fossil-fuel free, sustainable clean energy system.

                        <p class="post-text">
                        Let’s begin with a simple thought experiment. The way we lit up our houses has changed 
                        vastly over the past few decades - from the old-style incandescent bulbs which cost a lot 
                        of money in usage and mainte...nance to the LED and/or CFL lamps which are less expensive 
                        and much more energy efficient. Yet we now use more resources to lighten up our homes and 
                        gardens and the road-sides than we ever did in the past. Does that mean the attempt to 
                        reduce energy consumption by making the light bulbs more energy efficient and cheap ultimately 
                        fails because we are offsetting any efficiency gain by buying more appliances and larger houses?
                        <span class="dots">...</span>
                        <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                        This counterintuitive effect, known as the Jevons paradox, was first coined by the British 
                        economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book The coal question. Amidst industrial revolution, 
                        England started using more fuel-efficient steam engines expecting to facilitate longevity of 
                        Britain’s coal reserve. When James Watt’s steam engine became operational, it quintupled the 
                        energy efficiency of its predecessor, requiring much less coal to be burnt to carry out similar 
                        operations. The grand success of Watt’s steam engine indicated coal usage to significantly drop 
                        down if the technology is widely adopted in Britain. Much to his dismay, Jevon found that annual 
                        coal production in Britain had increased from about 5 million tons annually shortly before the 
                        invention of the Watt steam engine to over 100 million tons annually in 1865. This happened due 
                        to the fact that highly efficient Watt’s steam generated more opportunities for its new usage and 
                        rapidly proliferated in different industrial applications, enhancing the chances of profit and 
                        economic growth, which lead to even higher demand for coal than ever before. Jevon observed this 
                        counterproductive outcome and predicted that over a long period of time, this effect can strongly 
                        offset the original gains from energy efficiency.
    
                        This appears to be a serious concern to energy economists and policy makers as it points to the 
                        fact that in our attempt of making things more fuel efficient, we may cause more consumption, 
                        and hence rapid exhaustion, of the same fuel. An interesting supposition. Although the original 
                        version of Jevons paradox was based on the usage of coal, it has later been extended to apply to 
                        other commodities, including cars, aviations, and electricity.
                            
                        Intrigued by this counterintuitive effect, I decided to take a closer look into this paradox and 
                        assess its applicability in today’s world. While Jevon was correct to predict the role of the energy 
                        efficient steam engine in leading to an over-consumption of coal, I think the interpretations are 
                        not that simple given the complex nature of this problem. The very first point is that increased 
                        efficiency is not the problem but it can initiate the issue if it is associated with a price drop. 
                        For example, the discovery of internal combustion engines has offered a much efficient way of burning 
                        the fuels, but their demand didn’t spike up until the car companies figured out how to mass produce 
                        these vehicles and bring them to public at an affordable price. Secondly, the degree of adopting 
                        energy efficient appliances depend on multiple factors - its proper availability, delivery channels' 
                        trustworthiness, people’s attitude towards the usage of the product etc - and not only on its economic
                        attractiveness.  It is important to understand that the sensitivity towards the cost of input can vary 
                        extensively with the hike in the commodity’s demand. If the reduction in price create a large increase 
                        in demand, then the demand is considered ‘elastic’. On the other hand, if the effect of reduction in 
                        price does not affect the demand much, then the demand is considered ‘inelastic’. The example chosen 
                        by Jevon was an extreme case where the processes involved in the operation of the steam engine was highly 
                        sensitive to the cost of coal. All cases need not necessarily exhibit this high degree of cost sensitivity. 
                        An excellent example is the case of California where per-capita electricity usage has been kept flat for 
                        the last 30 years while increasing per-capita income by almost 80%.
                            
                        In mainstream economics, Jevons paradox is considered an extreme case of the more generalised ‘rebound 
                        effect’. Energy-related demand curves are often quite inelastic as for most of their components, energy 
                        is just one of many inputs, so they are less sensitive to the cost of energy. Since these effects are 
                        consistently minor than the ‘backfire’ effect proposed by Jevon indicate that his postulates are real 
                        but less important in the context of energy services. While efficiency is one of the tools for a 
                        sustainable future energy system, it is not the only one. There are other strategies and policies for 
                        reducing demands for fossil fuels, such as carbon tax, applying systems like cap-and-trade, using 
                        time-of-use pricing, promoting electricity generation from renewables, requiring automakers to improve 
                        fuel economy standards, etc.
                            
                        Back in 1865 when Jevon came up with his famous paradox, the world was unaware of the development of 
                        energy substitutes for coal, the value of crude oil in shaping economy, and most importantly, the 
                        climate issue and how it is impacted by burning fossil fuels. While Jevons observations were impressive, 
                        its conclusions require some additional modifications. It must be understood that a reduction in price 
                        of an excellent appliance definitely increases its market value, but does not guarantee its wide-spread 
                        adaptation.
                            
                        Jevons’ proposition that with more wealth in hand, people will tend to spend more on unnecessary things 
                        than they would have done otherwise - deeply concerns me. This statement discourages any innovation that 
                        involves economic growth, technological advancement and improved efficiencies. Efficiency saves us time, 
                        brings more prosperity to our lives. It should be emphasized here that one must realize that investing 
                        more in energy-efficient appliances will not solve the energy problems, but it is definitely the first 
                        step. It is imperative that we must keep our endeavours to achieve further improvements in efficiencies. 
                        I believe the remaining problems can be solved by educating people to better understand the ideas of 
                        resource limitations, the social and environmental impact on over-consumption of products, and the ethics 
                        of buying stuff based on minimal requirements. Discouraging the progress of civilization is simply 
                        atrocious and disturbing.
                            
                        However, Jevons paradox has managed to emerge out every few years and be the highlight of news, conference 
                        meets and policy decisions mainly due to its very simple nature. Time after time, some people, mostly 
                        politicians, have wrongly interpreted and misconstructed Jevons paradox to undermine policy efforts aimed 
                        at promoting energy efficiency. What’s even more baffling is that esteemed and popular magazines, like 
                        The New Yorker, also often promote this type of thinking. These people often use Jevons paradox to explain 
                        why investing in efficient appliances can be a wastage of both time and money and opt for ‘inaction’ 
                        via citing this paradox. This is extremely appalling. We now live in a world where we are constantly 
                        bombarded by severe threats like rapid climate change, increased global warming, rise of sea level, 
                        extinction of life as we know it. We have already reached a tipping point with 400 ppm in our atmosphere 
                        and the only way to ensure sustainability of human life is to bring immediate action against climate change. 
                        The consequence of any form of delayed action on climate change can be catastrophic. In this delicate period, 
                        we need to be careful about interpreting the ideas like the Jevons paradox put in front of us.

                    <p class="myself">
                        I am a computer programmer, writer and a philanthropist, dedicated my life in
                        analyzing complex real world problems to make improved decisions for a better 
                        tomorrow. Trained in meteorological applications in energy system studies, I 
                        have an extensive background working with a variety of datasets and using 
                        advanced statistical and numerical models. My lifelong desire to learn more 
                        about different cultures has driven me from India, to Germany, then to Denmark,
                        and now to the USA. Everyday, I try to learn something new, whether that be 
                        about energy systems, artificial intelligence or some miscellaneous fact about
                        the universe.
